    Closure
    A Closure is nothing but a function inside another function.
    This closure function can access the variables inside its 
    own scope, the outer function's variables and the global variables.
    Example
    In this example, whenever we call the myClosure function the value 
    of i will be increased by one. i will be set to zero only once and 
    only the inner function will be called everytime when myClosure is 
    called*/

    var myClosure = (function () {
        var i = 0;
        return function () { return i += 1; }
    })();
    myClosure();//i=1
    myClosure();//i=2
    myClosure();//i=3
